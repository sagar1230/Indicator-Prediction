# Indicator-Prediction
Uses linear regression to predict future stock prices and applies moving average indicators to the prediction to get early trade signals.

As these are lagging indicators, a signal in the prediction period can be acted on early. All past signals are also shown below.

These tests show changes in indication over a year if the program was followed everyday of 2019.

Using closer fit indicators with a shorter prediction period allows for making more frequent trades with stocks with higher volatility and in periods with less predictability.

These tests show changes in indication over a year if the program was followed everyday up until 11-15-2020.
